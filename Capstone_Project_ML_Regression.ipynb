This project would help not only yes bank but to all those banks who want to predict their future and are in conundrum for their future. So Machine Learning is helping us to resolve the issue of all those companies and firms who want to gather some courage in order to survive in the market for a longer time. By predicting the price with the acquaintance of Machine Learning especially the linear Regression and other regressors, which helped firms and companies to sustain in the market. In this project the monthly Open,Close,Low and High prices of Yes Bank stock have helped to train the model on which learning occurred and then the respective prediction occurs."

Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether Time Series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations. This Dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, opening, highest and lowest stock prices of every month. The main objective is to predict the closing stock price of the month."
